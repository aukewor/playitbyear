        This exhibition joins images with sounds, introducing architectural and technological elements which facilitate, reproduce, and collage conversations across the spatial and temporal distances which are a part of student life this semester. It aims to create a layered space for broadcasting and listening, among members of the YSoA community and beyond, about precedent and originality, agency and contingency.

        How do you find and position ourselves amidst the avowedly neutral haze of plurality? Do you ever find yourself muted by that haze, which favors privilege over justice? What is at stake for you, and how do you navigate the frictions of one positionality against another? Play it by Ear is a space in which the traces of our thoughts are left on the walls and in the air. This room aims to serve as a collector, amplifier, recorder, and juxtaposer of meaning, precedent, and story.

        In this collective experiment, we seek an intersubjectivity within architectural pedagogy - by students, for students. Such interaction already takes place in the institutionalized formats of the studio, the critique, and the late hours between, but there is an opportunity in the student gallery for a lower-stakes, counter-performative discourse that remains comfortable with uncertainty, error, unoriginality, ambiguity, and discomfort.

        The black aesthetic isn’t about fixed hierarchies or material value, it’s about how you treat material. It’s what you do with it, how you bend it. How you shape it. How you deform it. What you juxtapose it with. How one takes a “high” material like gold, and turns it into some Dookie chain shit. That’s asserting our own value.

        Architecture loves to tell the story of creation as making something out of nothing, like God on the first day or the sculptor with his block of marble. But there are other stories and other ways of telling. The strongest stories reveal ourselves and our work as they actually are - borrowed pieces of ever-changing worldviews; ghosts of other people we’ve encountered or never met; snippets of strange and unfinished dreams; and fragments of a million forgettings and misrememberings all collaged together into a new, coherent whole.

        Taking our cue from multidisciplinary artist Arthur Jafa and his 2016 film “Love Is the Message, the Message Is Death”, this issue of Paprika! invites contributors to utilize collage as storytelling and imagery as the primary material. Within the parameters of a [not yet defined] page, how might images and/or text (no more than 200 words) create a visceral vernacular in their confrontation, juxtaposition, overlap, spilling and mixing? What conversations might arise along shared borders or from the conjunction of difference between disparate images (and even between one submission and another), each a sentence in an ongoing interchange? How might we feed a new idea of architecture or creation and our place within it out of scraps, shards, found footage or artifacts- giblets instead of tenderloin? All of us connected, parts of a larger story while ourselves our own stories, telling and being told?
      </p>

        If a picture is worth a thousand words, and love is still the message, then the message is ego death by a thousand cuts.
